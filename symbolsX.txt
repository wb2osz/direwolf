This original APRS symbol specification is updated periodically with 
new symbols as they are defined.  This is THE master list for APRS. But
almost all new symbols since 2007 will be formed as Overlays to the 
basic set. So be sure to check the symbols-new.txt file noted below!

http://aprs.org/symbols/symbols-new.txt

NEW OVERLAYS ON ALL ALTERNATE SYMBOLS: As of 1 October 2007, the use of 
overlay characters on all alternate symbols was allowed as needed in 
order to further expand the APRS symbol set.  These overlay expansions 
of up to 36 different usages for each of the 94 alternate symbols adds 
hundreds of potential new symbols.  Since each of the original 94 
symbols can now have up to 36 other definitions, this new overlay info
is now found in the above file.

If an alternate symbol from the table below, contains significant
definitions of its overlay characters, then the entry will have an "O"
added to indicate that additonal definitions exist in the above 
document.  The # symbol indicates the original Overlay subset.

For details on Upgrading your symbol set, please see the background
information on Symbols prepared by Stephen Smith, WA8LMF:

SYMBOLS for APRS 1.1 ADDENDUM are as below.  As of 26 July 04, the
symbols below were approved and became part of the APRS1.1 addendum.

JunJul 04 to add a Rocket "\O" and an SUV as "\k"
06 May 04 to move Shelter(overlay) from PRI to ALT table
 5 Jan 04 to add Destination Waypoint "\/")
29 Oct 03 to add 802.11, firenet, IncidentCommandPost & Shelter


04 Feb 04:  Unassigned symbols should display the international symbol
            of a circle with a slash through it.  Meaning "not"...

29 Jan 04:  Reviewed ALL symbols in the spec.  Here are all additions:
   \& = is not just HF, but ANY GATEWAY with overlay character            
   /) = Wheelchair (Handicapped) useful in Marathons (blue and white)
   \) = Firenet MEO symbol (MODIS Earth observation)
   \/ = Waypoint (destination) a RED dot showing intended destination. 
        Uses special processing to draw a line from a mobile to his
        destination.  This was proposed 5 Jan 2004
   /L = Logged-ON user.  (A PC symbol showing someone on APRS-IS)
   /l = Laptop (lower case L) (looks like a laptop)
   /c = Incident Command Post
   \y = Skywarn (black tornado, orange background with white surround)
   \z = Shelter (with overlay) (A red house with peaked roof)

JUST-MOBILE-SYMBOLS:  The following two lists of symbols were defined
as "mobile" symbols for the purposess of filtering etc.  This list
has been published in APRS1.1 for over a decade.  As of Nov08, this
list was reviewd and updated:

WAS:
Pri:  '<=>()*0COPRSUXY[^abefgjkpsuv
Alt:  /0>AKOS[^knsuv

IS NOW:
Pri:  !'<=>()*0123456789CFOPRSUXY[\^abefgjkpsuv  <== [added !F\ ]

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The character after the latitude "N/S" in an APRS position report is a 
TABLE character and the character following the longitude "E/W" is the 
APRS symbol character.  The TABLE character selects one of two symbol 
tables or may be used as an alphanumeric overlay over some symbols:

        TABLE    RESULT            
         &       RESERVED for possible AUXILLIARY tables (Aug 09)
         /       Primary   symbol Table  (Mostly stations)
         \       Alternate symbol table  (Mostly Objects)
         0-9     Alternate OVERLAY symbols with 0-9 overlayed
         A-Z     Alternate OVERLAY symbols with A-Z overlayed
      
For ease of reference we refer to these as the SYMBOL CHARACTERS and
often abbreviate them as "/$" which refers to the Table character "/"
and symbol character "$".

Press F1-S in APRSdos to see these symbols.  Some symbols may have a
numeric overlay character 0-9 or A-Z.  These are shown on the F1-S
display with the numeral "3" overlayed.  The original overlayable 
symbols through Oct 2007 were:

  CIRCLE, SQUARE, CAR, TRUCK, VAN, DIGIS, GATES
  Civil-Defense(RACES), NWS sites, WX stations, Triangle

After 2007, provisions should be made in all software to allow for
overlays on *any/all* alternate symbols for use in the future.

SYMBOLS WITH STAND-ALONE GPS TRACKERS:  Stand-alone devices that
transmit raw GPS have no method to convey their symbol.  For this
unique application, the symbol can be designated in the UNPROTO 
TOADDRESS of the form GPSxyz.  The X points to a subgroup table and 
the Y is the actual symbol.  Z is an overlay character if used.   
Actually there are four TOCALLS that will provide the same symbol.

   GPSxyz is for stand alone trackers
   SPCxyz is for stand alone trackers at SPECIAL events in SPCL mode
   SYMxyz is for other TNC-only stations such as WX stations

Notice that both the /$ method and GPSxyz method have a one-for-one
corrspondence for all numeric and alphabetic symbols of both upper 
and lower case which should make them easy to remember.  For the 
GPSxyz method, we have broken the PRIMARY and ALTERNATE tables into 
sub tables with different names to make them easier to remember.  For 
example, "/C" is a CANOE in the PRIMARY table which can be referred to 
as PC in the XYZ format and the "\C" ALTERNATE table symbol is for 
Coast Guard which could also be referred to in the GPSxyz format as 
AC.   Simillarly, you can think  of the lower case symbols /c or \c as 
being LC for lower case C and SC for "secondary" table "c".

The Following Symbol table shows the two types of identifiers for all
APRS ICONS.  The primary symbols are on the left and the alternate 
table is on the right.  The first column of each is labeled /$ and \$ 
for the primary and alternate tables.  These are the chacacters you 
will see in an APRS formatted position report.  The XYZ columns are 
for the stand-alone trackers described above.

HEADING SYMBOLS:  Although all symbols are supposed to have a heading
line showing the direction of movement with a length proportional to
the log of speed, some symbols were desiged as top-down views so that 
they could be displayed actually always POINTING in the direction of 
movement.  Now All symbols should be oriented (if practical).  These 
original special symbols were:
 
\> OVERLAYED CAR
\s Overlayed Ship
\^ Overlayed Aircraft
/^ Aircraft
/g Glider
\n Overlayed Triangle

AREA SYMBOLS!  The special symbol \l (lower case L) was special.  It
indicates an area definition.  You can define these as a BOX, CIRCLE,
LINE or TRIANGLE area in all colors, either open or filled in, any 
size from 60 feet to 100 miles.  In APRSdos they were generated auto-
matically by simply moving the cursor to the location, press HOME, 
move the cursor to the lower right corner of the AREA and hit INPUT-
ADD-OBJECTS-AREA.  

Enter the type of area, and color.  NOTE that AREA shapes can only be 
defined by selecting the upper left corner first, then the lower right 
second.  The line is an exception.  It is still top to bottom, but the 
lower point can be to the left of the beginning point.  Further, in 
the line option you may specify a "width" either side of the central 
line.

These AREAS are useful for real-time events such as for a search-and-
rescue, or adding a special ROAD or ROUTE for a special event.  Be 
cautious in using the color fill option, since all other objects in 
that area that occur earlier in your PLIST will be obscured.  AND you 
do NOT know the order of other stations P-lists. 

AREAS FORMAT: Use of the special AREAS symbol (/l) triggers special
processing of the next 7 bytes normally used for CSE and SPD.  In 
this special case the processing is as follows:

$CSE/SPD...  Normal Field description

lTyy/Cxx...  Where:  l (lower case L) is  symbol for "LOCATION SHAPES"
                     T is Type of shape:  0=circle, 1=line, 2=elipse
                                          3=triangle 4=box
                                          add 5 to these => color-in
                     C is color from 0 to 15.  For colors geater than
                       9, / is replaced with a 1.
                    yy is sqroot of the latitude offset in 1/100ths
                    xx is sqroot of the longitude offset
                       
These offsets are ALWAYS positive to the right and down, except for 
the special case of a lower right quadrant line, these are given the 
Type of 6 and are drawn down and to the left.

HURRICANES, TROPICAL STORMS and DEPRESSIONS:  These symbols will be
differentiated by colors red, yellos, and blue.  Additionally a radius
of Huricane and also Tropical storm winds will also be shown if the
special format detailed in WX.txt is used.

SYMBOLS ON MAPS!  APRS can also be permanently embedded in maps.  To 
embed a symbol in a map, simply make the first four characters of the 
label be a # followed by the dual symbol character, followed by a hex 
number from 1 to F that indicates the color for the symbol.  The 
remaining 8 characters can be used for a conventional label at the 
same location.  An example are the VORTAC nav-aids in Alaska.  The 
Anchorage VORTAC appears as ANC on all maps below 128 miles. The label 
entry is #\VFANC,LAT,LONG,128.

VALUE SIGNPOSTS:  This is another special handling Symbol.  Signposts
trigger a display as a yellow box with a 1-3 letter overlay on them. 
The use of this symbol (\m) triggers a search for a 1-3 letter 
string of characters encolsed in braces in the comment field.  

Thus a VALUE Signpost with {55} in the comment field would 
appear as a sign with 55 on it, designed for posting the speed 
of traffic past speed measuring devices. APRSdos has a version named
APRStfc.EXE that monitors traffic speed and posts these speed signs
objects when traffic slows in these areas.  To avoid cluttering the 
map, they ONLY appear at 8 miles and below AND they do not show any 
callsign or name.  Only the yellow box and the 3 letters or numbers.  
Select them from the OBJECT menu under VALUE...

APRS 1.2 OVERLAY TYPE SYMBOLS EXPANSION!  [April 2007]:
-------------------------------------------------------

All alternate symbols have the potential to be overlayed.  This was 
the original intent and was only limited to a few due to limitations 
in Mac and WinAPRS.  Those original "numbered" symbols are marked 
with a # in the table above.  But by 2007, it was time to move on.  
In APRS 1.2 it was proposed that any ALTENATE symbol can have overlays.
Kenwood has already responded with the new D710 that can now display 
these overlays on all symbols.  

To help define these hundreds of new symbol combinations, we have
added a new file called:

http:aprs.org/symbols/symbols-new.txt

The overlay symbols may be used in two ways.  First, simply as an 
overlay on a basic symbol type.  Most uses of these symbols will be
in this manner.  But special overlays on some special characters
may also be re-drawn as entirely new graphics for clarity if desired.

The above NEW-Overlay document attempts to define those special
combinations that may rate their own special symbol or where multiple
use of an overlay character for different purposes would be confusing.
