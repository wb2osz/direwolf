.TH DIREWOLF 1

.SH NAME
direwolf \- Soundcard TNC for packet radio.


.SH SYNOPSIS
.B direwolf 
[ \fIoptions\fR ]
[ \- | \fBudp:\fR9999 ]
.P
The first audio channel can be streamed thru stdin or a UDP port.  This is typically used with an SDR receiver.


.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBdirewolf\fR  is a software "soundcard" modem/TNC and APRS encoder/decoder.   
It can be used stand-alone to receive APRS messages, as a digipeater, 
APRStt gateway, or Internet Gateway (IGate).    
It can also be used as a virtual TNC for other applications such as 
APRSIS32, UI-View32, Xastir, APRS-TW, YAAC, UISS, Linux AX25, SARTrack, 
RMS Express, and many others. 


.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI "-c " "file"
Read configuration file from specified location rather than the default locations.

Generate daily log files in specified directory.  Use "." for current directory.

.TP
.BI "-L " "logfile"
Generate single log file with fixed name.

.TP
.BI "-r " "n"
Audio sample rate per second for first channel.  Default 44100.

.TP
.BI "-n " "n"
Number of audio channels for first device.  1 or 2.  Default 1.

.TP
.BI "-b " "n"
Audio sample size for first channel.  8 or 16.  Default 16.

.TP

.RS
.RS
300 bps defaults to AFSK tones of 1600 & 1800.
.P
1200 bps uses AFSK tones of 1200 & 2200.
.P
2400 bps uses QPSK based on V.26 standard.
.P
4800 bps uses 8PSK based on V.27 standard.
.P
9600 bps and up uses K9NG/G3RUH standard.
.P
AIS for ship Automatic Identification System.

.SH EXAMPLES
gqrx (2.3 and later) has the ability to send streaming audio through a UDP socket to another application for further processing. 
direwolf can listen over a UDP port with options like this:
.RS
.P
direwolf \-n 1 \-r 48000 \-b 16 udp:7355
.RE
.P
Other SDR applications might produce audio on stdout so it is convenient to pipe into the next application.  In this example, the final "-" means read from stdin.
