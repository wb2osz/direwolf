# Consult the User Guide for more details on configuration options.
#
#
# These are the most likely settings you might change:
#
#	(1)   	MYCALL 	-  call sign and SSID for your station.
#
#			Look for lines starting with MYCALL and 
#			change NOCALL to your own.
#
#
#	(2)	PBEACON	-  enable position beaconing.
#
#			Look for lines starting with PBEACON and 
#			modify for your call, location, etc.
#
#
#	(3)	DIGIPEATER  -  configure digipeating rules.
#
#			Look for lines starting with DIGIPEATER.
#			Most people will probably use the given example.
#			Just remove the "#" from the start of the line
#			to enable it.
#
#
#	(4)	IGSERVER, IGLOGIN  - IGate server and login
#
#			Configure an IGate client to relay messages between 
#			radio and internet servers.
#
#
# The default location is "direwolf.conf" in the current working directory.
# On Linux, the user's home directory will also be searched.
# An alternate configuration file location can be specified with the "-c" command line option.  
#
# As you probably guessed by now, # indicates a comment line.
#
# Remove the # at the beginning of a line if you want to use a sample
# configuration that is currently commented out.
#
# Commands are a keyword followed by parameters.
#
# Command key words are case insensitive.  i.e. upper and lower case are equivalent.
#
# Command parameters are generally case sensitive.  i.e. upper and lower case are different.
#
# Example:  The next two are equivalent
#
#	PTT /dev/ttyS0 RTS
#	ptt /dev/ttyS0 RTS
#
# But this not equivalent because device names are case sensitive.
#
#	PTT /dev/TTYs0 RTS

# Many people will simply use the default sound device.
# Some might want to use an alternative device by chosing it here.

#	Available audio input devices for receive (*=selected):
#	  0: Microphone (Realtek High Defini
#	  1: Microphone (Bluetooth SCO Audio
#	  2: Microphone (Bluetooth AV Audio)

# Example: To use the USB Audio, use a command like this with
# the input and output device numbers.  (Remove the # comment character.)

#ADEVICE  3 5 

# The position in the list can change when devices (e.g. USB) are added and removed.

# Here is an example of specifying the USB Audio device.
# This is case-sensitive.  Upper and lower case are not treated the same.

# Linux ALSA is complicated.  See User Guide for discussion.
# To use something other than the default, generally use plughw
# and a card number reported by "arecord -l" command.  Examples:

# ADEVICE  plughw:CARD=Device,DEV=0
# ADEVICE  plughw:1,0

# Starting with version 1.0, you can also use "-" or "stdin" to 
# pipe stdout from some other application such as a software defined
# radio.  You can also specify "UDP:" and an optional port for input.
# Something different must be specified for output.

# ADEVICE - plughw:1,0
# ADEVICE UDP:7355 default


#
# This is the sound card audio sample rate.
# The default is 44100.  Other standard values are 22050 or 11025.

# Change this only if your computer can't keep up.
# A lower rate means lower CPU demands but performance will be degraded.

#
# 200 Hz shift is normally used for 300 baud HF SSB operation.
#
# Note that if you change the tones here, you will need to adjust
# your tuning dial accordingly to get the same transmitted frequencies.
#
# In the second example, we have 7 demodulators spaced 30 Hz apart
# to capture signals that are off frequency.
# If you run out of CPU power, drop the audio sample rate down to 22050.

# If not using a VOX circuit, the transmitter Push to Talk (PTT) 
# control is usually wired to a serial port with a suitable interface circuit.

# For the PTT command, specify the device and either RTS or DTR.
# RTS or DTR may be preceded by "-" to invert the signal.

#
# On Linux, you can also use general purpose I/O pins if

# After turning on transmitter, send "flag" characters for

#
# Keep transmitting for TXTAIL * 10 milliseconds after sending

# Dire Wolf acts as a virtual TNC and can communicate with
# two different protocols:
#	- the "AGW TCPIP Socket Interface" - default port 8000
#	- KISS TNC via serial port
#	- KISS protocol over TCP socket - default port 8001
#
# See descriptions of AGWPORT, KISSPORT, and NULLMODEM in the
# User Guide for more details.
#

AGWPORT 8000
KISSPORT 8001

#
# Some applications are designed to operate with only a physical
# TNC attached to a serial port.  For these, we provide a virtual serial
# port ("pseudo terminal" in Linux) that appears to be connected to a TNC.
#
# Linux:
# 	Linux applications can often specify "/tmp/kisstnc"
# 	for the serial port name.  Behind the scenes, Dire Wolf 
# 	creates a pseudo terminal.  Unfortunately we can't specify the name
# 	and we wouldn't want to reconfigure the application each time.
# 	To get around this, /tmp/kisstnc is a symbolic link to the
# 	non-constant pseudo terminal name.
#
# 	Use the -p command line option to enable this feature.
#
# Windows:
# 
#  	Microsoft Windows applications need a serial port
# 	name like COM1, COM2, COM3, or COM4.
#
# 	Take a look at the User Guide for instructions to set up
# 	two virtual serial ports named COM3 and COM4 connected by
# 	a null modem.
#
# 	Using the default configuration, Dire Wolf will connect to 
# 	COM3 and the client application will use COM4.
#
# 	Uncomment following line to use this feature.

# First you need to specify the name of a Tier 2 server.  
# The current preferred way is to use one of these regional rotate addresses:

#	noam.aprs2.net 		- for North America
#	soam.aprs2.net		- for South America
#	euro.aprs2.net		- for Europe and Africa
#	asia.aprs2.net 		- for Asia
#	aunz.aprs2.net		- for Oceania 

#IGSERVER noam.aprs2.net

# You also need to specify your login name and passcode. 
# Contact the author if you can't figure out how to generate the passcode.
 
#IGLOGIN WB2OSZ-5 123456

# That's all you need for a receive only IGate which relays
# messages from the local radio channel to the global servers.

# Some might want to send an IGate client position directly to a server
# without sending it over the air and relying on someone else to 
# forward it to an IGate server.  This is done by using sendto=IG rather
# than a radio channel number. Overlay R for receive only, T for two way.

#PBEACON sendto=IG delay=0:30 every=60:00 symbol="igate" overlay=R lat=42^37.14N long=071^20.83W 
#PBEACON sendto=IG delay=0:30 every=60:00 symbol="igate" overlay=T lat=42^37.14N long=071^20.83W 


# To relay messages from the Internet to radio, you need to add
# one more option with the transmit channel number and a VIA path.

#IGTXVIA 0 WIDE1-1

# You might want to apply a filter for what packets will be obtained from the server.
# Read about filters here:  http://www.aprs2.net/wiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FilterGuide
# Example:

#IGFILTER m/50 

# Finally, we don't want to flood the radio channel.  
# The IGate function will limit the number of packets transmitted 
# during 1 minute and 5 minute intervals.   If a limit would 
# be exceeded, the packet is dropped and message is displayed in red.
