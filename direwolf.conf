# These are the most likely settings you might change:
#
#	(1)   	MYCALL 	-  call sign and SSID for your station.
#
#			Look for lines starting with MYCALL and 
#			change NOCALL to your own.
#
#	(2)	PBEACON	-  enable position beaconing.
#
#			Look for lines starting with PBEACON and 
#			modify for your call, location, etc.
#
#	(3)	DIGIPEATER  -  configure digipeating rules.
#
#			Look for lines starting with DIGIPEATER.
#			Most people will probably use the given example.
#			Just remove the "#" from the start of the line
#			to enable it.
#
#	(4)	IGSERVER, IGLOGIN  - IGate server and login
#
#			Configure an IGate client to relay messages between 
#			radio and internet servers.

#
# The default location is "direwolf.conf" in the current working directory.

# Station identifier for this channel.
# Multiple channels can have the same or different names.
#
# It can be up to 6 letters and digits with an optional ssid.
# The APRS specification requires that it be upper case.
#
# Example (don't use this unless you are me):  MYCALL	WB2OSZ-5
#

MYCALL N0CALL

#
# Pick a suitable modem speed based on your situation.
#	1200 	Most common for VHF/UHF.  Default if not specified.
#	300	Low speed for HF SSB.
#	9600	High speed - Can't use Microphone and Speaker connections.
#
# In the simplest form, just specify the speed. 
# 

MODEM 1200
#MODEM 300
#MODEM 9600

#
# These are the defaults should be fine for most cases.  In special situations, 
# you might want to specify different AFSK tones or the baseband mode which does
# not use AFSK.
#
#MODEM 1200 1200:2200
#MODEM 300  1600:1800
#MODEM 9600 0:0
#
#
# On HF SSB, you might want to use multiple demodulators on slightly different
# frequencies to compensate for stations off frequency.  Here we have 7 different
# demodulators at 30 Hz intervals.  This takes a lot of CPU power so you will 
# probably need to reduce the audio sampling rate with the /n option.

#MODEM 300 1600:1800 7@30 /4


#
# Uncomment line below to enable the DTMF decoder for this channel.
#

#DTMF

# 
# If not using a VOX circuit, the transmitter Push to Talk (PTT) 
# control is usually wired to a serial port with a suitable interface circuit.  
# DON'T connect it directly!
#
# For the PTT command, specify the device and either RTS or DTR.
# RTS or DTR may be preceded by "-" to invert the signal.
# Both can be used for interfaces that want them driven with opposite polarity.
#
# COM1 can be used instead of /dev/ttyS0, COM2 for /dev/ttyS1, and so on.
#

#PTT COM1 RTS
#PTT COM1 RTS -DTR
#PTT /dev/ttyUSB0 RTS

#
# On Linux, you can also use general purpose I/O pins if
# your system is configured for user access to them. 
# This would apply mostly to microprocessor boards, not a regular PC.
# See separate Raspberry Pi document for more details.
# The number may be preceded by "-" to invert the signal.

# The Data Carrier Detect (DCD) signal can be sent to the same places
# as the PTT signal.  This could be used to light up an LED like a normal TNC.

# First you need to specify the name of a Tier 2 server.  
# The current preferred way is to use one of these regional rotate addresses:

#	noam.aprs2.net 		- for North America
#	soam.aprs2.net		- for South America
#	euro.aprs2.net		- for Europe and Africa
#	asia.aprs2.net 		- for Asia
#	aunz.aprs2.net		- for Oceania 

#IGSERVER noam.aprs2.net

# You also need to specify your login name and passcode. 
# Contact the author if you can't figure out how to generate the passcode.
 
#IGLOGIN WB2OSZ-5 123456

# That's all you need for a receive only IGate which relays
# messages from the local radio channel to the global servers.

# Some might want to send an IGate client position directly to a server
# without sending it over the air and relying on someone else to 
# forward it to an IGate server.  This is done by using sendto=IG rather
# than a radio channel number. Overlay R for receive only, T for two way.

#PBEACON sendto=IG delay=0:30 every=60:00 symbol="igate" overlay=R lat=42^37.14N long=071^20.83W 
#PBEACON sendto=IG delay=0:30 every=60:00 symbol="igate" overlay=T lat=42^37.14N long=071^20.83W 


# To relay messages from the Internet to radio, you need to add
# one more option with the transmit channel number and a VIA path.

#IGTXVIA 0 WIDE1-1

# You might want to apply a filter for what packets will be obtained from the server.
# Read about filters here:  http://www.aprs-is.net/javaprsfilter.aspx
# Example, positions and objects within 50 km of my location:

#IGFILTER m/50 

# That is known as a server-side filter.  It is processed by the IGate server.
# You can also apply local filtering to limit what will be transmitted on the 
# RF side.  For example, transmit only "messages" on channel 0 and weather 
# reports on channel 1. 

#FILTER IG 0 t/m
#FILTER IG 1 t/wn

# Finally, we don't want to flood the radio channel.  
# The IGate function will limit the number of packets transmitted 
# during 1 minute and 5 minute intervals.   If a limit would 
# be exceeded, the packet is dropped and message is displayed in red.
