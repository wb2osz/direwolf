 *
 * Name:	ax25_link
 *
 * Purpose:	Data Link State Machine.
 *		Establish connections and transfer data in the proper
 *		order with retries.
 *
 *		Using the term "data link" is rather unfortunate because it causes
 *		confusion to someone familiar with the OSI networking model.
 *		This corresponds to the layer 4 transport, not layer 2 data link.
 *
 * Description:	
 *
 *		Typical sequence for establishing a connection
 *		initiated by a client application.  Try version 2.2,
 *		get refused, and fall back to trying version 2.0.
 *
 *
 *	State		Client App		State Machine		Peer
 *	-----		----------		-------------		----
 *
 *	0 disc
 *			Conn. Req  --->
 *						SABME  --->
 *	5 await 2.2
 *								  <---	FRMR or DM *note
 *						SABM  --->
 *	1 await 2.0
 *								  <---	UA
 *					  <---	CONN Ind.
 *	3 conn
 *
 *
 *		Typical sequence when other end initiates connection.
 *
 *
 *	State		Client App		State Machine		Peer
 *	-----		----------		-------------		----
 *
 *	0 disc
 *								  <---	SABME or SABM
 *						UA  --->
 *					  <---	CONN Ind.
 *	3 conn
 *
 *
 *	*note:
 *
 * 	After carefully studying the v2.2 spec, I expected a 2.0 implementation to send
 *	FRMR in response to SABME.  This is important.  If a v2.2 implementation
 *	gets FRMR, in response to SABME, it switches to v2.0 and sends SABM instead.
 *
 *	The v2.0 protocol spec, section 2.3.4.3.3.1, states that FRMR should be sent when
 *	an invalid or not implemented command is received.  That all fits together.
 *
 *	In testing, I found that the KPC-3+ sent DM.
 *
 *	I can see where they might get that idea.
 *	The v2.0 spec says that when in disconnected mode, it should respond to any
 *	command other than SABM or UI frame with a DM response with P/F set to 1.
 *	I think it was implemented wrong.  2.3.4.3.3.1 should take precedence.
 *
 *	The TM-D710 does absolutely nothing in response to SABME.
 *	Not responding at all is just plain wrong.   To work around this, I put
 *	in a special hack to start sending SABM after a certain number of
 *	SABME go unanswered.   There is more discussion in the User Guide.

 *
 *		* AX.25 Link Access Protocol for Amateur Packet Radio Version 2.2 Revision: July 1998
 *
 *			http://www.ax25.net/AX25.2.2-Jul%2098-2.pdf
 *
 *			I accidentally stumbled across this one when searching for some sort of errata
 *			list for the original protocol specification. 
 *
 *				"This is a new version of the 1998 standard. It has had all figures
 *				 redone using Microsoft Visio. Errors in the SDL have been corrected."
 *
 *			The SDL diagrams are dated 2006.  I wish I had known about this version, with
 *			several corrections, before doing most of the implementation.  :-(
 *
 *			The title page still says July 1998 so it's not immediately obvious this
 *			is different than the one on the TAPR site.
 *
 *		* AX.25  ...  Latest revision, in progress.
 *
 *			http://www.nj7p.org/
 *
 *			This is currently being revised in cooperation with software authors
 *			who have noticed some issues during implementation.
 *
 *		The functions here are based on the SDL diagrams but turned inside out.
 *		It seems more intuitive to have a function for each type of input and then decide
 *		what to do depending on the state.  This also reduces duplicate code because we
 *		often see the same flow chart segments, for the same input, appearing in multiple states.
 *
 * Errata:	The protocol spec has many places that appear to be errors or are ambiguous so I wasn't
 *		sure what to do.  These should be annotated with "erratum" comments so we can easily go
 *		back and revisit them.
 *
 * X.25:	The AX.25 protocol is based on, but does not necessarily adhere to, the X.25 protocol.
 *		Consulting this might provide some insights where the AX.25 spec is not clear.
 *
 *			http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.25-199610-I/en/
 *  
 * Version 1.4, released April 2017:
 *
 *		Features tested reasonably well:
 *
 *			Connect to/from a KPC-3+ and send I frames in both directions.
 *			Same with TM-D710A.
 *			v2.2 connect between two instances of direwolf.  (Can't find another v2.2 for testing.)
 *			Modulo 8 & 128 sequence numbers.
 *			Recovery from simulated transmission errors using either REJ or SREJ.
 *			XID frame for parameter negotiation.
 *			Segments to allow data larger than max info part size.
 *
 *		Implemented but not tested properly:
 *
 *			Connecting thru digipeater(s).
 *			Acting as a digipeater.
 *			T3 timer.
 *			Compatibility with additional types of TNC.
 *
 * Version 1.5, December 2017:
 *
 *		Implemented Multi Selective Reject.
 *		More efficient generation of SREJ frames.
 *		Reduced number of duplicate I frames sent for both REJ and SREJ cases.
 *		Avoided unnecessary RR when I frame could take care of the ack.
 *		(This led to issue 132 where outgoing data sometimes got stuck in the queue.)

 *
 * Name:	get_link_handle
 * 
 * Purpose:	Find existing (or possibly create) state machine for a given link.
 *		It should be possible to have a large number of links active at the
 *		same time.  They are uniquely identified by 
 *		(owncall, peercall, client id, radio channel)
 *		Note that we could have multiple client applications, all sharing one
 *		TNC, on the same or different radio channels, completely unware of each other.
 *
 * Inputs:	addrs		- Owncall, peercall, and optional digipeaters.
 *				  For ease of passing this around, it is an array in the
 *				  same order as in the frame.
 *
 *		num_addr	- Number of addresses, 2 thru 10.
 *
 *		chan		- Radio channel number.
 *
 *		client		- Client app number.
 *				  We allow multiple concurrent applications with the 
 *				  AGW network protocol.  These are identified as 0, 1, ...
 *				  We don't know this for an incoming frame from the radio
 *				  so it is -1 at this point. At a later time will will
 *				  associate the stream with the right client.
 *
 *		create		- True if OK to create a new one.
 *				  Otherwise, return only one already existing.
 *
 *				  This should always be true for outgoing frames.
 *				  For incoming frames this would be true only for SABM(e)
 *				  with all digipeater fields marked as used.
 *
 *				  Here, we will also check to see if it is in our 
 *				  registered callsign list.
 *
 * Returns:	Handle for data link state machine.  
 *		NULL if not found and 'create' is false.
 *
 * Description:	Try to find an existing entry matching owncall, peercall, channel,
 *		and client.  If not found create a new one.

 *
 *		C6.1 Segmenter State Machine
 *		Only the following DL primitives will be candidates for modification by the segmented
 *		state machine:

 *		* DL-DATA Request. The user employs this primitive to provide information to be
 *		transmitted using connection-oriented procedures; i.e., using I frames. The
 *		segmenter state machine examines the quantity of data to be transmitted. If the
 *		quantity of data to be transmitted is less than or equal to the data link parameter
 *		N1, the segmenter state machine passes the primitive through transparently. If the
 *		quantity of data to be transmitted exceeds the data link parameter N1, the
 *		segmenter chops up the data into segments of length N1-2 octets. Each segment is
 *		prepended with a two octet header. (See Figures 3.1 and 3.2.) The segments are
 *		then turned over to the Data-link State Machine for transmission, using multiple DL
 *		Data Request primitives. All segments are turned over immediately; therefore the
 *		Data-link State Machine will transmit them consecutively on the data link.
 *
 * Erratum:	Not sure how to interpret that.  See example below for how it was implemented.
 *
 * Version 1.6:	Bug 252.  Segmentation was occurring for a V2.0 link.  From the spec:
 *			"The receipt of an XID response from the other station establishes that both
 *			stations are using AX.25 version 2.2 or higher and enables the use of the
 *			segmenter/reassembler and selective reject."
 *			"The segmenter/reassembler procedure is only enabled if both stations on the
 *			link are using AX.25 version 2.2 or higher."
 *
 *		The Segmenter Ready State SDL has no decision based on protocol version.

 *
 * Name:	i_frame
 * 
 * Purpose:	Process I Frame.
 *
 * Inputs:	S	- Data Link State Machine.
 *		cr	- Command or Response.  We have already issued an error if not command.
 *		p	- Poll bit.  Assuming we checked earlier that it was a command.
 *			  The meaning is described below.
 *		nr	- N(R) from the frame.  Next expected seq. for other end.
 *		ns	- N(S) from the frame.  Seq. number of this incoming frame.
 *		pid	- protocol id.
 *		info_ptr - pointer to information part of frame.
 *		info_len - Number of bytes in information part of frame.
 *			   Should be in range of 0 thru n1_paclen.
 *
 * Description:	
 *		6.4.2. Receiving I Frames
 *
 *		The reception of I frames that contain zero-length information fields is reported to the next layer; no information
 *		field will be transferred.
 *
 *		6.4.2.1. Not Busy
 *
 *		If a TNC receives a valid I frame (one with a correct FCS and whose send sequence number equals the
 *		receiver's receive state variable) and is not in the busy condition, it accepts the received I frame, increments its
 *		receive state variable, and acts in one of the following manners:
 *
 *		a) If it has an I frame to send, that I frame may be sent with the transmitted N(R) equal to its receive state
 *		variable V(R) (thus acknowledging the received frame). Alternately, the TNC may send an RR frame with N(R)
 *		equal to V(R), and then send the I frame.
 *
 *		or b) If there are no outstanding I frames, the receiving TNC sends an RR frame with N(R) equal to V(R). The
 *		receiving TNC may wait a small period of time before sending the RR frame to be sure additional I frames are
 *		not being transmitted.
 *
 *		6.4.2.2. Busy
 *
 *		If the TNC is in a busy condition, it ignores any received I frames without reporting this condition, other than
 *		repeating the indication of the busy condition.
 *		If a busy condition exists, the TNC receiving the busy condition indication polls the sending TNC periodically
 *		until the busy condition disappears.
 *		A TNC may poll the busy TNC periodically with RR or RNR frames with the P bit set to "1".
 *
 *		6.4.6. Receiving Acknowledgement
 *
 *		Whenever an I or S frame is correctly received, even in a busy condition, the N(R) of the received frame is
 *		checked to see if it includes an acknowledgement of outstanding sent I frames. The T1 timer is canceled if the
 *		received frame actually acknowledges previously unacknowledged frames. If the T1 timer is canceled and there
 *		are still some frames that have been sent that are not acknowledged, T1 is started again. If the T1 timer expires
 *		before an acknowledgement is received, the TNC proceeds with the retransmission procedure outlined in Section
 *		6.4.11.
 *
 *
 *		6.2. Poll/Final (P/F) Bit Procedures
 *
 *		The next response frame returned to an I frame with the P bit set to "1", received during the information
 *		transfer state, is an RR, RNR or REJ response with the F bit set to "1".
 *
 *		The next response frame returned to a S or I command frame with the P bit set to "1", received in the
 *		disconnected state, is a DM response frame with the F bit set to "1".

/*------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Name:	i_frame_continued
 * 
 * Purpose:	The I frame processing logic gets pretty complicated.
 *		Some of it has been split out into a separate function to make
 *		things more readable.
 *		We have already done some error checking and processed N(R).
 *		This is used for both states 3 & 4.
 *
 * Inputs:	S	- Data Link State Machine.  We are in state 3.
 *		p	- Poll bit.
 *		ns	- N(S) from the frame.  Seq. number of this incoming frame.
 *		pid	- protocol id.
 *		info_ptr - pointer to information part of frame.
 *		info_len - Number of bytes in information part of frame.  Already verified.
 *			   
 * Description:	
 *
 *		4.3.2.3. Reject (REJ) Command and Response
 *
 *		The reject frame requests retransmission of I frames starting with N(R). Any frames sent with a sequence
 *		number of N(R)-1 or less are acknowledged. Additional I frames which may exist may be appended to the
 *		retransmission of the N(R) frame.
 *		Only one reject frame condition is allowed in each direction at a time. The reject condition is cleared by the
 *		proper reception of I frames up to the I frame that caused the reject condition to be initiated.
 *		The status of the TNC at the other end of the link is requested by sending a REJ command frame with the P bit
 *		set to one.
 *
 *		4.3.2.4. Selective Reject (SREJ) Command and Response
 *
 * 	(Erratum: SREJ is only response with F bit.)
 *
 *		The selective reject, SREJ, frame is used by the receiving TNC to request retransmission of the single I frame
 *		numbered N(R). If the P/F bit in the SREJ frame is set to "1", then I frames numbered up to N(R)-1 inclusive are
 *		considered as acknowledged. However, if the P/F bit in the SREJ frame is set to "0", then the N(R) of the SREJ
 *		frame does not indicate acknowledgement of I frames.
 *
 *		Each SREJ exception condition is cleared (reset) upon receipt of the I frame with an N(S) equal to the N(R)
 *		of the SREJ frame.
 *
 *		A receiving TNC may transmit one or more SREJ frames, each containing a different N(R) with the P bit set
 *		to "0", before one or more earlier SREJ exception conditions have been cleared. However, a SREJ is not
 *		transmitted if an earlier REJ exception condition has not been cleared as indicated in Section 4.5.4. (To do so
 *		would request retransmission of an I frame that would be retransmitted by the REJ operation.) Likewise, a REJ
 *		frame is not transmitted if one or more earlier SREJ exception conditions have not been cleared as indicated in
 *
 *		Section 4.5.4.
 *
 *		I frames transmitted following the I frame indicated by the SREJ frame are not retransmitted as the result of
 *		receiving a SREJ frame. Additional I frames awaiting initial transmission may be transmitted following the
 *		retransmission of the specific I frame requested by the SREJ frame.
 *
 *
 *		6.4.4. Reception of Out-of-Sequence Frames
 *
 *		6.4.4.1. Implicit Reject (REJ)
 *
 *		When an I frame is received with a correct FCS but its send sequence number N(S) does not match the current
 *		receiver's receive state variable, the frame is discarded. A REJ frame is sent with a receive sequence number
 *		equal to one higher than the last correctly received I frame if an uncleared N(S) sequence error condition has not
 *		been previously established. The received state variable and poll bit of the discarded frame is checked and acted
 *		upon, if necessary.
 *		This mode requires no frame queueing and frame resequencing at the receiver. However, because the mode
 *		requires transmission of frames that may not be in error, its throughput is not as high as selective reject. This
 *		mode is ineffective on systems with long round-trip delays and high data rates.
 *
 *		6.4.4.2. Selective Reject (SREJ)
 *
 *		When an I frame is received with a correct FCS but its send sequence number N(S) does not match the current
 *		receiver's receive state variable, the frame is retained. SREJ frames are sent with a receive sequence number
 *		equal to the value N(R) of the missing frame, and P=1 if an uncleared SREJ condition has not been previously
 *		established. If an SREJ condition is already pending, an SREJ will be sent with P=0. The received state variable
 *		and poll bit of the received frame are checked and acted upon, if necessary.
 *		This mode requires frame queueing and frame resequencing at the receiver. The holding of frames can
 *		consume precious buffer space, especially if the user device has limited memory available and several active
 *		links are operational.
 *
 *		6.4.4.3. Selective Reject-Reject (SREJ/REJ)
 *
 *	(Erratum: REJ/SREJ should not be mixed.  Basic (mod 8) allows only REJ.
 *		  Extended (mod 128) gives you a choice of one or the other for a link.)
 *
 *		When an I frame is received with a correct FCS but its send sequence number N(S) does not match the current
 *		receiver's receive state variable, and if N(S) indicates 2 or more frames are missing, a REJ frame is transmitted.
 *		All subsequently received frames are discarded until the lost frame is correctly received. If only one frame is
 *		missing, a SREJ frame is sent with a receive sequence number equal to the value N(R) of the missing frame. The
 *		received state variable and poll bit of the received frame are checked and acted upon. If another frame error
 *		occurs prior to recovery of the SREJ condition, the receiver saves all frames received after the first errored frame
 *		and discards frames received after the second errored frame until the first errored frame is recovered. Then, a
 *		REJ is issued to recover the second errored frame and all subsequent discarded frames.

 * Name:	is_ns_in_window
 * 
 * Purpose:	Is the N(S) value of the incoming I frame in the expected range?
 *
 * Inputs:	ns		- Sequence from I frame.
 *
 * Description:	With selective reject, it is possible that we could receive a repeat of
 *		an I frame with N(S) less than V(R).  In this case, we just want to
 *		discard it rather than getting upset and reestablishing the connection.
 *
 *		The X.25 spec,section 2.4.6.4 (b) asks whether  V(R) < N(S) < V(R)+k.
 *		
 *		The problem here is that it depends on the value of k for the other end.
 *		X.25 says that both sides need to agree on a common value of k ahead of time.
 *		We might have k=8 for our sending but the other side could have k=32 so
 *		this test could fail.
 *
 *		As a hack, we could use the value 63 here.  If too small we would discard
 *		I frames that are in the acceptable range because they would be >= V(R)+k.
 *		On the other hand, if this value is too big, the range < V(R) would not be
 *		large enough and we would accept frame we shouldn't.
 *		As a practical matter, using a window size that large is pretty unlikely.
 *		Maybe I could put a limit of 63, rather than 127 in the configuration.

 * Name:	rej_frame
 * 
 * Purpose:	Process REJ Frame.
 *
 * Inputs:	S	- Data Link State Machine.
 *		cr	- Is this command or response?
 *		pf	- Poll/Final bit.
 *		nr	- N(R) from the frame.
 *
 * Description:	4.3.2.2. Receive Not Ready (RNR) Command and Response
 *
 *		... The RNR condition is cleared by the sending of a UA, RR, REJ or SABM(E) frame. ...
 *
 *
 *		4.3.2.3. Reject (REJ) Command and Response
 *
 *		The reject frame requests retransmission of I frames starting with N(R). Any frames sent with a sequence
 *		number of N(R)-1 or less are acknowledged. Additional I frames which may exist may be appended to the
 *		retransmission of the N(R) frame.
 *		Only one reject frame condition is allowed in each direction at a time. The reject condition is cleared by the
 *		proper reception of I frames up to the I frame that caused the reject condition to be initiated.
 *		The status of the TNC at the other end of the link is requested by sending a REJ command frame with the P bit
 *		set to one.
 *
 *		4.4.3. Reject (REJ) Recovery
 *
 *		The REJ frame requests a retransmission of I frames following the detection of a N(S) sequence error. Only
 *		one outstanding "sent REJ" condition is allowed at a time. This condition is cleared when the requested I frame
 *		has been received.
 *		A TNC receiving the REJ command clears the condition by resending all outstanding I frames (up to the
 *		window size), starting with the frame indicated in N(R) of the REJ frame.
 *
 *
 *		4.4.5.1. T1 Timer Recovery
 *
 *		If a transmission error causes a TNC to fail to receive (or to receive and discard) a single I frame, or the last I
 *		frame in a sequence of I frames, then the TNC does not detect a send-sequence-number error and consequently
 *		does not transmit a REJ/SREJ. The TNC that transmitted the unacknowledged I frame(s) following the completion
 *		of timeout period T1, takes appropriate recovery action to determine when I frame retransmission as described
 *		in Section 6.4.10 should begin. This condition is cleared by the reception of an acknowledgement for the sent
 *		frame(s), or by the link being reset.
 *
 *		6.2. Poll/Final (P/F) Bit Procedures
 *
 *		The response frame returned by a TNC depends on the previous command received, as described in the
 *		following paragraphs.
 *		...
 *
 *		The next response frame returned to an I frame with the P bit set to "1", received during the information5
 *		transfer state, is an RR, RNR or REJ response with the F bit set to "1".
 *
 *		The next response frame returned to a supervisory command frame with the P bit set to "1", received during
 *		the information transfer state, is an RR, RNR or REJ response frame with the F bit set to "1".
 *		...
 *
 *		The P bit is used in conjunction with the timeout recovery condition discussed in Section 4.5.5.
 *		When not used, the P/F bit is set to "0".
 *
 *		6.4.4.1. Implicit Reject (REJ)
 *
 *		When an I frame is received with a correct FCS but its send sequence number N(S) does not match the current
 *		receiver's receive state variable, the frame is discarded. A REJ frame is sent with a receive sequence number
 *		equal to one higher than the last correctly received I frame if an uncleared N(S) sequence error condition has not
 *		been previously established. The received state variable and poll bit of the discarded frame is checked and acted
 *		upon, if necessary.
 *		This mode requires no frame queueing and frame resequencing at the receiver. However, because the mode
 *		requires transmission of frames that may not be in error, its throughput is not as high as selective reject. This
 *		mode is ineffective on systems with long round-trip delays and high data rates.
 *
 *		6.4.7. Receiving REJ
 *
 *		After receiving a REJ frame, the transmitting TNC sets its send state variable to the same value as the REJ
 *		frame's received sequence number in the control field. The TNC then retransmits any I frame(s) outstanding at
 *		the next available opportunity in accordance with the following:
 *
 *		a) If the TNC is not transmitting at the time and the channel is open, the TNC may begin retransmission of the
 *		I frame(s) immediately.
 *		b) If the TNC is operating on a full-duplex channel transmitting a UI or S frame when it receives a REJ frame,
 *		it may finish sending the UI or S frame and then retransmit the I frame(s).
 *		c) If the TNC is operating in a full-duplex channel transmitting another I frame when it receives a REJ frame,
 *		it may abort the I frame it was sending and start retransmission of the requested I frames immediately.
 *		d) The TNC may send just the one I frame outstanding, or it may send more than the one indicated if more I
 *		frames followed the first unacknowledged frame, provided that the total to be sent does not exceed the flowcontrol
 *		window (k frames).
 *		If the TNC receives a REJ frame with the poll bit set, it responds with either an RR or RNR frame with the
 *		final bit set before retransmitting the outstanding I frame(s).

 *
 * Name:	srej_frame
 * 
 * Purpose:	Process SREJ Response.
 *
 * Inputs:	S	- Data Link State Machine.
 *		cr	- Is this command or response?
 *		f	- Final bit.   When set, it is ack-ing up thru N(R)-1
 *		nr	- N(R) from the frame.  Peer has asked for a resend of I frame with this N(S).
 *		info	- Information field, used only for Multi-SREJ
 *		info_len - Information field length, bytes.
 *
 * Description:	4.3.2.4. Selective Reject (SREJ) Command and Response
 *
 *		The selective reject, SREJ, frame is used by the receiving TNC to request retransmission of the single I frame
 *		numbered N(R). If the P/F bit in the SREJ frame is set to "1", then I frames numbered up to N(R)-1 inclusive are
 *		considered as acknowledged. However, if the P/F bit in the SREJ frame is set to "0", then the N(R) of the SREJ
 *		frame does not indicate acknowledgement of I frames.
 *
 *		Each SREJ exception condition is cleared (reset) upon receipt of the I frame with an N(S) equal to the N(R)
 *		of the SREJ frame.
 *
 *		A receiving TNC may transmit one or more SREJ frames, each containing a different N(R) with the P bit set
 *		to "0", before one or more earlier SREJ exception conditions have been cleared. However, a SREJ is not
 *		transmitted if an earlier REJ exception condition has not been cleared as indicated in Section 4.5.4. (To do so
 *		would request retransmission of an I frame that would be retransmitted by the REJ operation.) Likewise, a REJ
 *		frame is not transmitted if one or more earlier SREJ exception conditions have not been cleared as indicated in
 *		Section 4.5.4.
 *
 *		I frames transmitted following the I frame indicated by the SREJ frame are not retransmitted as the result of
 *		receiving a SREJ frame. Additional I frames awaiting initial transmission may be transmitted following the
 *		retransmission of the specific I frame requested by the SREJ frame.
 *
 * Erratum:	The section above always refers to SREJ "frames."  There doesn't seem to be any clue about when
 *		command vs. response would be used.  When we look in the flow charts, we see that we generate only
 *		responses but the code is there to process command and response slightly differently.
 *
 * Description:	4.4.4. Selective Reject (SREJ) Recovery
 *
 *		The SREJ command/response initiates more-efficient error recovery by requesting the retransmission of a
 *		single I frame following the detection of a sequence error. This is an advancement over the earlier versions in
 *		which the requested I frame was retransmitted together with all additional I frames subsequently transmitted and
 *		successfully received.
 *
 *		When a TNC sends one or more SREJ commands, each with the P bit set to "0" or "1", or one or more SREJ
 *		responses, each with the F bit set to "0", and the "sent SREJ" conditions are not cleared when the TNC is ready
 *		to issue the next response frame with the F bit set to "1", the TNC sends a SREJ response with the F bit set to "1",
 *		with the same N(R) as the oldest unresolved SREJ frame.
 *
 *		Because an I or S format frame with the F bit set to "1" can cause checkpoint retransmission, a TNC does not
 *		send SREJ frames until it receives at least one in-sequence I frame, or it perceives by timeout that the checkpoint
 *		retransmission will not be initiated at the remote TNC.
 *
 *		With respect to each direction of transmission on the data link, one or more "sent SREJ" exception conditions
 *		from a TNC to another TNC may be established at a time. A "sent SREJ" exception condition is cleared when
 *		the requested I frame is received.
 *
 *		The SREJ frame may be repeated when a TNC perceives by timeout that a requested I frame will not be
 *		received, because either the requested I frame or the SREJ frame was in error or lost.
 *
 *		When appropriate, a TNC receiving one or more SREJ frames initiates retransmission of the individual I
 *		frames indicated by the N(R) contained in each SREJ frame. After having retransmitted the above frames, new
 *		I frames are transmitted later if they become available.
 *
 *		When a TNC receives and acts on one or more SREJ commands, each with the P bit set to "0", or an SREJ
 *		command with the P bit set to "1", or one or more SREJ responses each with the F bit set to "0", it disables any
 *		action on the next SREJ response frame if that SREJ frame has the F bit set to "1" and has the same N(R) (i.e.,
 *		the same value and the same numbering cycle) as a previously actioned SREJ frame, and if the resultant
 *		retransmission was made following the transmission of the P bit set to a "1".
 *		When the SREJ mechanism is used, the receiving station retains correctly-received I frames and delivers
 *		them to the higher layer in sequence number order.
 *
 *
 *		6.4.4.2. Selective Reject (SREJ)
 *
 *		When an I frame is received with a correct FCS but its send sequence number N(S) does not match the current
 *		receiver's receive state variable, the frame is retained. SREJ frames are sent with a receive sequence number
 *		equal to the value N(R) of the missing frame, and P=1 if an uncleared SREJ condition has not been previously
 *		established. If an SREJ condition is already pending, an SREJ will be sent with P=0. The received state variable
 *		and poll bit of the received frame are checked and acted upon, if necessary.
 *
 *		This mode requires frame queueing and frame resequencing at the receiver. The holding of frames can
 *		consume precious buffer space, especially if the user device has limited memory available and several active
 *		links are operational.
 *
 *
 *		6.4.4.3. Selective Reject-Reject (SREJ/REJ)
 *
 *		When an I frame is received with a correct FCS but its send sequence number N(S) does not match the current
 *		receiver's receive state variable, and if N(S) indicates 2 or more frames are missing, a REJ frame is transmitted.
 *		All subsequently received frames are discarded until the lost frame is correctly received. If only one frame is
 *		missing, a SREJ frame is sent with a receive sequence number equal to the value N(R) of the missing frame. The
 *		received state variable and poll bit of the received frame are checked and acted upon. If another frame error
 *		occurs prior to recovery of the SREJ condition, the receiver saves all frames received after the first errored frame
 *		and discards frames received after the second errored frame until the first errored frame is recovered. Then, a
 *		REJ is issued to recover the second errored frame and all subsequent discarded frames.
 *
 * X.25:	States that SREJ is only response.  I'm following that and it simplifies matters.
 * 
 * X.25 2.4.6.6.1 & 2.4.6.6.2 make a distinction between F being 0 or 1 besides copying N(R) into V(A).
 *		They talk about sending a poll under some conditions.
 *		We don't do that here.  It seems to work reliably so leave well enough alone.

 *		The TNC confirms reception and acceptance of a SABME command by sending a UA response frame at the

 *
 *		A TNC that uses a version of AX.25 prior to v2.2 responds with a FRMR. ** (see note below)
 *
 *
 * Note:	The KPC-3+, which does not appear to support v2.2, responds with a DM.
 *		The 2.0 spec, section 2.3.4.3.5, states, "While a DXE is in the disconnected mode, it will respond

 *
 *		While in the information-transfer state, either TNC may indicate a request to disconnect the link by transmitting
 *		a DISC command frame and starting timer T1.
 *
 *		After receiving a valid DISC command, the TNC sends a UA response frame and enters the disconnected
 *		state. After receiving a UA or DM response to a sent DISC command, the TNC cancels timer T1 and enters the
 *		disconnected state.
 *
 *		If a UA or DM response is not correctly received before T1 times out, the DISC frame is sent again and T1 is

 * Purpose:	Process DM Response Frame.
 *
 * Inputs:	S	- Data Link State Machine.
 *		f	- Final bit.
 *
 * Description:	4.3.3.1. Set Asynchronous Balanced Mode (SABM) Command
 *
 *		The TNC confirms reception and acceptance of a SABM command by sending a UA response frame at the
 *		earliest opportunity. If the TNC is not capable of accepting a SABM command, it responds with a DM frame if
 *		possible.
 *
 *		The TNC confirms reception and acceptance of a SABME command by sending a UA response frame at the
 *		earliest opportunity. If the TNC is not capable of accepting a SABME command, it responds with a DM frame.
 *
 *		A TNC that uses a version of AX.25 prior to v2.2 responds with a FRMR.
 *		( I think the KPC-3+ has a bug - it replies with DM - WB2OSZ )
 *
 *		4.3.3.5. Disconnected Mode (DM) Response
 *
 *		The disconnected mode response is sent whenever a TNC receives a frame other than a SABM(E) or UI
 *		frame while in a disconnected mode. The disconnected mode response also indicates that the TNC cannot
 *		accept a connection at the moment. The DM response does not have an information field.
 *		Whenever a SABM(E) frame is received and it is determined that a connection is not possible, a DM frame is
 *		sent. This indicates that the called station cannot accept a connection at that time.
 *		While a TNC is in the disconnected mode, it responds to any command other than a SABM(E) or UI frame
 *		with a DM response with the P/F bit set to "1".
 *
 *		4.3.3.6. Unnumbered Information (UI) Frame
 *
 *		A received UI frame with the P bit set causes a response to be transmitted. This response is a DM frame when
 *		in the disconnected state, or an RR (or RNR, if appropriate) frame in the information transfer state.
 *
 *		6.3.1. AX.25 Link Connection Establishment
 *
 *		If the distant TNC receives a SABM command and cannot enter the indicated state, it sends a DM frame.
 *		When the originating TNC receives a DM response to its SABM(E) frame, it cancels its T1 timer and does
 *		not enter the information-transfer state.
 *
 *		6.3.4. Link Disconnection
 *
 *		After receiving a valid DISC command, the TNC sends a UA response frame and enters the disconnected
 *		state. After receiving a UA or DM response to a sent DISC command, the TNC cancels timer T1 and enters the
 *		disconnected state.
 *
 *		6.5. Resetting Procedure
 *
 *		If a DM response is received, the TNC enters the disconnected state and stops timer T1. If timer T1 expires
 *		before a UA or DM response frame is received, the SABM(E) is retransmitted and timer T1 restarted. If timer T1
 *		expires N2 times, the TNC enters the disconnected state. Any previously existing link conditions are cleared.
 *		Other commands or responses received by the TNC before completion of the reset procedure are discarded.
 *
 * Erratum:	The flow chart shows the same behavior for states 1 and 5.
 *		For state 5, I think we should treat DM the same as FRMR.

 * Name:	UA_frame
 * 
 * Purpose:	Process UA Response Frame.
 *
 * Inputs:	S	- Data Link State Machine.
 *		f	- Final bit.
 *
 * Description:	4.3.3.4. Unnumbered Acknowledge (UA) Response
 *
 *		The UA response frame acknowledges the reception and acceptance of a SABM(E) or DISC command
 *		frame. A received command is not actually processed until the UA response frame is sent. Information fields are
 *		not permitted in a UA frame.
 *
 *		4.4.1. TNC Busy Condition
 *
 *		When a TNC is temporarily unable to receive I frames (e.g., when receive buffers are full), it sends a Receive
 *		Not Ready (RNR) frame. This informs the sending TNC that the receiving TNC cannot handle any more I
 *		frames at the moment. This receiving TNC clears this condition by the sending a UA, RR, REJ or SABM(E)
 *		command frame.
 *
 *		6.2. Poll/Final (P/F) Bit Procedures
 *
 *		The response frame returned by a TNC depends on the previous command received, as described in the
 *		following paragraphs.
 *		The next response frame returned by the TNC to a SABM(E) or DISC command with the P bit set to "1" is a
 *		UA or DM response with the F bit set to "1".
 *
 *		6.3.1. AX.25 Link Connection Establishment
 *
 *		To connect to a distant TNC, the originating TNC sends a SABM command frame to the distant TNC and
 *		starts its T1 timer. If the distant TNC exists and accepts the connect request, it responds with a UA response
 *		frame and resets all of its internal state variables (V(S), V(A) and V(R)). Reception of the UA response frame by
 *		the originating TNC causes it to cancel the T1 timer and set its internal state variables to "0".
 *
 *		6.5. Resetting Procedure
 *
 *		A TNC initiates a reset procedure whenever it receives an unexpected UA response frame, or after receipt of
 *		a FRMR frame from a TNC using an older version of the protocol.

 * Name:	frmr_frame
 * 
 * Purpose:	Process FRMR Response Frame.
 *
 * Inputs:	S	- Data Link State Machine.
 *
 * Description:	4.3.3.2. Set Asynchronous Balanced Mode Extended (SABME) Command
 *		...
 *		The TNC confirms reception and acceptance of a SABME command by sending a UA response frame at the
 *		earliest opportunity. If the TNC is not capable of accepting a SABME command, it responds with a DM frame.
 *		A TNC that uses a version of AX.25 prior to v2.2 responds with a FRMR.
 *
 *		4.3.3.9. FRMR Response Frame
 *
 *		The FRMR response is removed from the standard for the following reasons:
 *		a) UI frame transmission was not allowed during FRMR recovery;
 *		b) During FRMR recovery, the link could not be reestablished by the station that sent the FRMR;
 *		c) The above functions are better handled by simply resetting the link with a SABM(E) + UA exchange;
 *		d) An implementation that receives and process FRMRs but does not transmit them is compatible with older
 *		   versions of the standard; and
 *		e) SDL is simplified and removes the need for one state.
 *		This version of AX.25 operates with previous versions of AX.25. It does not generate a FRMR Response
 *		frame, but handles error conditions by resetting the link.
 *
 *		6.3.2. Parameter Negotiation Phase
 *
 *		Parameter negotiation occurs at any time. It is accomplished by sending the XID command frame and
 *		receiving the XID response frame. Implementations of AX.25 prior to version 2.2 respond to an XID command
 *		frame with a FRMR response frame. The TNC receiving the FRMR uses a default set of parameters compatible
 *		with previous versions of AX.25.
 *
 *		6.5. Resetting Procedure
 *
 *		The link resetting procedure initializes both directions of data flow after a unrecoverable error has occurred.
 *		This resetting procedure is used only in the information-transfer state of an AX.25 link.
 *		A TNC initiates a reset procedure whenever it receives an unexpected UA response frame, or after receipt of
 *		a FRMR frame from a TNC using an older version of the protocol.

 *
 *		pf	- Poll/Final bit.
 *
 * Description:	4.3.3.7 Exchange Identification (XID) Frame
 *
 *		The Exchange Identification frame causes the addressed station to identify itself, and
 *		to provide its characteristics to the sending station. An information field is optional within
 *		the XID frame. A station receiving an XID command returns an XID response unless a UA
 *		response to a mode setting command is awaiting transmission, or a FRMR condition
 *		exists.
 *
 *		The XID frame complies with ISO 8885. Only those fields applicable to AX.25 are
 *		described. All other fields are set to an appropriate value. This implementation is
 *		compatible with any implementation which follows ISO 8885. Only the general-purpose
 *		XID information field identifier is required in this version of AX.25.
 *
 *		The information field consists of zero or more information elements. The information
 *		elements start with a Format Identifier (FI) octet. The second octet is the Group Identifier
 *		(GI). The third and forth octets form the Group Length (GL). The rest of the information
 *		field contains parameter fields.
 *
 *		The FI takes the value 82 hex for the general-purpose XID information. The GI takes
 *		the value 80 hex for the parameter-negotiation identifier. The GL indicates the length of
 *		the associated parameter field. This length is expressed as a two-octet binary number
 *		representing the length of the associated parameter field in octets. The high-order bits of
 *		length value are in the first of the two octets. A group length of zero indicates the lack of
 *		an associated parameter field and that all parameters assume their default values. The GL
 *		does not include its own length or the length of the GI.
 *
 *		The parameter field contains a series of Parameter Identifier (PI), Parameter Length
 *		(PL), and Parameter Value (PV) set structures, in that order. Each PI identifies a
 *		parameter and is one octet in length. Each PL indicates the length of the associated PV in
 *		octets, and is one octet in length. Each PV contains the parameter value and is PL octets
 *		in length. The PL does not include its own length or the length of its associated PI. A PL
 *		value of zero indicates that the associated PV is absent; the parameter assumes the
 *		default value. A PI/PL/PV set may be omitted if it is not required to convey information, or
 *		if present values for the parameter are to be used. The PI/PL/PV fields are placed into the
 *		information field of the XID frame in ascending order. There is only one entry for each
 *		PI/PL/PV field used. A parameter field containing an unrecognized PI is ignored. An
 *		omitted parameter field assumes the currently negotiated value.

 * Description:	4.4.5.1. T1 Timer Recovery
 *
 *		If a transmission error causes a TNC to fail to receive (or to receive and discard) a single I frame, or the last I
 *		frame in a sequence of I frames, then the TNC does not detect a send-sequence-number error and consequently
 *		does not transmit a REJ/SREJ. The TNC that transmitted the unacknowledged I frame(s) following the completion
 *		of timeout period T1, takes appropriate recovery action to determine when I frame retransmission as described
 *		in Section 6.4.10 should begin. This condition is cleared by the reception of an acknowledgement for the sent
 *		frame(s), or by the link being reset.
 *
 *		6.7.1.1. Acknowledgment Timer T1
 *
 *		T1, the Acknowledgement Timer, ensures that a TNC does not wait indefinitely for a response to a frame it
 *		sends. This timer cannot be expressed in absolute time; the time required to send frames varies greatly with the
 *		signaling rate used at Layer 1. T1 should take at least twice the amount of time it would take to send maximum
 *		length frame to the distant TNC and get the proper response frame back from the distant TNC. This allows time
 *		for the distant TNC to do some processing before responding.
 *		If Layer 2 repeaters are used, the value of T1 should be adjusted according to the number of repeaters through
 *		which the frame is being transferred.

 * Inputs:	S	- Data Link State Machine.
 *
 * Description:	TODO:  still don't understand this.
 *
 *		4.4.5.2. Timer T3 Recovery
 *
 *		Timer T3 ensures that the link is still functional during periods of low information transfer. When T1 is not
 *		running (no outstanding I frames), T3 periodically causes the TNC to poll the other TNC of a link. When T3
 *		times out, an RR or RNR frame is transmitted as a command with the P bit set, and then T1 is started. When a
 *		response to this command is received, T1 is stopped and T3 is started. If T1 expires before a response is
 *		received, then the waiting acknowledgement procedure (Section 6.4.11) is executed.
 *
 *		6.7.1.3. Inactive Link Timer T3
 *
 *		T3, the Inactive Link Timer, maintains link integrity whenever T1 is not running. It is recommended that
 *		whenever there are no outstanding unacknowledged I frames or P-bit frames (during the information-transfer
 *		state), an RR or RNR frame with the P bit set to "1" be sent every T3 time units to query the status of the other
 *		TNC. The period of T3 is locally defined, and depends greatly on Layer 1 operation. T3 should be greater than
 *		T1; it may be very large on channels of high integrity.

 *
 *		T3:	Not activity for substantial amount of time.
 *			Poke the other end to see if it is still there.
 *			
 * 
 * Observation:	This is the only place where we send RR command with P=1.
 *
 * Sequence of events:
 *
 *		We send some I frames to the other guy.
 *		There are outstanding sent I frames for which we did not receive ACK.
 *
 *		Timer 1 expires when we are in state 3: send RR/RNR command P=1 (here). Enter state 4.
 *		Timer 1 expires when we are in state 4: same until max retry count is exceeded.
 *
 *					Other guy gets RR/RNR command P=1.
 *					Same action for either state 3 or 4.
 *					Whether he has outstanding un-ack'ed sent I frames is irrelevant.
 *					He calls "enquiry response" which sends RR/RNR response F=1.
 *					(Read about detour 1 below and in enquiry_response.)
 *
 *		I get back RR/RNR response F=1.  Still in state 4.
 *		Of course, N(R) gets copied into V(A).

 *		Otherwise, "invoke retransmission" to resend everything after N(R).

 *		I frames.  Why not send the SREJ again instead of backing up and resending
 *		stuff which already got there OK?"

 *		The code to handle incoming SREJ in state 4 is there but stop T1 is in the

 * Name:	select_t1_value
 *
 * Purpose:	Dynamically adjust the T1 timeout value, commonly a fixed time known as FRACK.
 *
 * Inputs:	S->rc			Retry counter.
 *
 *		S->srt			Smoothed roundtrip time in seconds.
 *
 *		S->t1_remaining_when_last_stopped
 *					Seconds left on T1 when it is stopped.
 *
 * Outputs:	S->srt			New smoothed roundtrip time.
 *
 *		S->t1v			How long to wait for an acknowledgement before resending.
 *					Value used when starting timer T1, in seconds.
 *					Here it is dynamically adjusted.
 *
 * Description:	How long should we wait for an ACK before sending again or giving up?
 *		some implementations have a fixed length time.  This is usually the FRACK parameter,
 *		typically 3 seconds (D710A) or 4 seconds (KPC-3+).
 *
 *		This should be increased for each digipeater in the path.
 *		Here it is dynamically adjusted by taking the average time it takes to get a response
 *		and then we double it.
 *
 * Rambling:	It seems like a good idea to adapt to channel conditions, such as digipeater delays,
 *		but it is fraught with peril if you are not careful.
 *
 *		For example, if we accept an incoming connection and only receive some I frames and
 *		send no I frames, T1 never gets started.  In my earlier attempt, 't1_remaining_when_last_stopped'
 *		had the initial value of 0 lacking any reason to set it differently.   The calculation here
 *		then kept pushing t1v up up up.  After receiving 20 I frames and sending none, 
 *		t1v was over 300 seconds!!!
 *
 *		We need some way to indicate that 't1_remaining_when_last_stopped' is not valid and
 *		not to use it.  Rather than adding a new variable, it is set to a negative value
 *		initially to mean it has not been set yet.  That solves one problem.
 *
 *		T1 is paused whenever the channel is busy, either transmitting or receiving,
 *		so the measured time could turn out to be a tiny fraction of a second, much less than
 *		the frame transmission time.
 *		If this gets too low, an unusually long random delay, before the sender's transmission,
 *		could exceed this.  I put in a lower limit for t1v, currently 1 second.
 *
 *		What happens if we get multiple timeouts because we don't get a response?
 *		For example, when we try to connect to a station which is not there, a KPC-3+ will give
 *		up and report failure after 10 tries x 4 sec = 40 seconds.
 *
 *		The algorithm in the AX.25 protocol spec shows increasing timeout values.
 *		It might seem like a good idea but either it was not thought out very well
 *		or I am not understanding it.  If it is doubled each time, it gets awful large
 *		very quickly.   If we try to connect to a station which is not there, 
 *		we want to know within a minute, not an hour later.
 *
 *		Keeping with the spirit of increasing the time but keeping it sane,
 *		I increase the time linearly by a fraction of a second.
