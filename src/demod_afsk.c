// The stronger tone probably has a better S/N ratio so we apply a larger

// Interesting idea but it did not work as well as the original AGC in this case.
// For VHF FM we are not dealing with rapid deep selective fading of one tone.
// Instead we have an imbalance which is the same for the whole frame.
// It might be interesting to try this with HF SSB packet which is much like RTTY.

// I use the term valley rather than noise floor.

 *
 * Name:        demod_afsk_process_sample
 *
 * Purpose:     (1) Demodulate the AFSK signal.
 *		(2) Recover clock and data.
 *
 * Inputs:	chan	- Audio channel.  0 for left, 1 for right.
 *		subchan - modem of the channel.
 *		sam	- One sample of audio.
 *			  Should be in range of -32768 .. 32767.
 *
 * Returns:	None 
 *
 * Descripion:	First demodulate the AFSK signal.
 *
 *		A digital phase locked loop (PLL) recovers the symbol
 *		clock and picks out data bits at the proper rate.
 *
 *		For each recovered data bit, we call:
 *
 *			  hdlc_rec (channel, demodulated_bit);
 *
 *		to decode HDLC frames from the stream of bits.
 *
 * Future:	This could be generalized by passing in the name
 *		of the function to be called for each bit recovered
 *		from the demodulator.  For now, it's simply hard-coded.
 *
 * Evolution:	The simple version works less well when there is a substantial difference
 *		in amplitude of the two tones.  e.g. When de-emphasis cuts the
 *		higher tone down to about half the amplitude. We overcome that
 *		by boosting the space amplitude by varying amounts before slicing.
 *
 *		In version 1.7 an entirely different approach is added, an FM
 *		discriminator which produces a result proportional to the 
 *		frequency.
 *
 *--------------------------------------------------------------------*/
/* 
 * Which tone is stronger?
 *
 * In an ideal world, simply compare.  In my first naive attempt, that
 * worked well with perfect signals. In the real world, we don't
 * have too many perfect signals.
 *
 * Here is an excellent explanation:
 * http://www.febo.com/packet/layer-one/transmit.html
 *
 * Under real conditions, we find that the higher tone usually has a
 * considerably smaller amplitude due to the passband characteristics
 * of the transmitter and receiver.  To make matters worse, it
 * varies considerably from one station to another.
 *
 * The two filters also have different amounts of DC bias.
 *
 * My solution was to apply automatic gain control (AGC) to the mark and space 
 * levels.  This works by looking at the minimum and maximum outputs
 * for each filter and scaling the results to be roughly in the -0.5 to +0.5 range.
 * Results were excellent after tweaking the attack and decay times.
 *
 * 4X6IZ took a different approach.  See QEX Jul-Aug 2012.
 *
 * He ran two different demodulators in parallel.  One of them boosted the higher
 * frequency tone by 6 dB.  Any duplicates were removed.  This produced similar results.
 * He also used a bandpass filter before the mark/space filters.  
 * I haven't tried this combination yet for 1200 baud.
 *
 * First, let's take a look at Track 1 of the TNC test CD.  Here the receiver
 * has a flat response.  We find the mark/space strength ratios very from 0.53 to 1.38
 * with a median of 0.81.  This is in line with expectations because most
 * transmitters add pre-emphasis to boost the higher audio frequencies.
 * Track 2 should more closely resemble what comes out of the speaker on a typical
 * transceiver.  Here we see a ratio from 1.73 to 3.81 with a median of 2.48.
 * 
 * This is similar to my observations of local signals, from the speaker.
