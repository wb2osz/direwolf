.TH DIREWOLF 1

.SH NAME
direwolf \- Soundcard TNC for packet radio.


.SH SYNOPSIS
.B direwolf 
[ \fIoptions\fR ]
[ \- | \fBudp:\fR9999 ]
.P
The first audio channel can be streamed thru stdin or a UDP port.  This is typically used with an SDR receiver.


.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBdirewolf\fR  is a software "soundcard" modem/TNC and APRS encoder/decoder.   
It can be used stand-alone to receive APRS messages, as a digipeater, 
APRStt gateway, or Internet Gateway (IGate).    
It can also be used as a virtual TNC for other applications such as 
APRSIS32, UI-View32, Xastir, APRS-TW, YAAC, UISS, Linux AX25, SARTrack, 
RMS Express, and many others.

.SH EXAMPLES
gqrx (2.3 and later) has the ability to send streaming audio through a UDP socket to another application for further processing. 
direwolf can listen over a UDP port with options like this:
.RS
.P
direwolf -n 1 -r 48000 -b 16 udp:7355
.RE
.P
Other SDR applications might produce audio on stdout so it is convenient to pipe into the next application.  In this example, the final "-" means read from stdin.
.RS
.P
rtl_fm -f 144.39M -o 4 - | direwolf -n 1 -r 24000 -b 16 -
