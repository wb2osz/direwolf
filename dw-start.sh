# Run this from crontab periodically to start up
# Dire Wolf automatically.

# See User Guide for more discussion.
# For release 1.4 it is section 5.7 "Automatic Start Up After Reboot"
# but it could change in the future as more information is added.


# Versioning (this file, not direwolf version)
#-----------
# v1.3 - KI6ZHD - added variable support for direwolf binary location
# v1.2 - KI6ZHD - support different versions of VNC
# v1.1 - KI6ZHD - expanded version to support running on text-only displays with 
#        auto support; log placement change
# v1.0 - WB2OSZ - original version for Xwindow displays only



#How are you running Direwolf : within a GUI (Xwindows / VNC) or CLI mode
#
#  AUTO mode is design to try starting direwolf with GUI support and then
#    if no GUI environment is available, it reverts to CLI support with screen
#
#  GUI mode is suited for users with the machine running LXDE/Gnome/KDE or VNC
#    which auto-logs on (sitting at a login prompt won't work)
#
#  CLI mode is suited for say a Raspberry Pi running the Jessie LITE version
#      where it will run from the CLI w/o requiring Xwindows - uses screen

RUNMODE=AUTO

# Location of the direwolf binary.  Depends on $PATH as shown.
# change this if you want to use some other specific location.
# e.g.  DIREWOLF="/usr/local/bin/direwolf"

DIREWOLF="direwolf"

#Direwolf start up command :: two examples where example one is enabled
#
# 1. For normal operation as TNC, digipeater, IGate, etc.
#    Print audio statistics each 100 seconds for troubleshooting.
#    Change this command to however you wish to start Direwolf

DWCMD="$DIREWOLF -a 100"

# 2. Alternative for running with SDR receiver.
#    Piping one application into another makes it a little more complicated.
