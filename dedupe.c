 * Name:	dedupe.c
 *
 * Purpose:	Avoid transmitting duplicate packets which are too
 *		close together.
 *
 *
 * Description:	We want to avoid digipeating duplicate packets to
 *		to help reduce radio channel congestion with 
 *		redundant information.
 *		Duplicate packets can occur in several ways:
 *
 *		(1) A digipeated packet can loop between 2 or more
 *			digipeaters.  For example:
 *
 *			W1ABC>APRS,WIDE3-3
 *			W1ABC>APRS,mycall*,WIDE3-2
 *			W1ABC>APRS,mycall,RPT1*,WIDE3-1
 *			W1ABC>APRS,mycall,RPT1,mycall*
 *
 *		(2) We could hear our own original transmission
 *			repeated by someone else.  Example:
 *
 *			mycall>APRS,WIDE3-3
 *			mycall>APRS,RPT1*,WIDE3-2
 *			mycall>APRS,RPT1*,mycall*,WIDE3-1
 *
 *		(3) We could hear the same packet from multiple
 *			digipeaters (with or without the original).
 *
 *			W1ABC>APRS,WIDE3-2
 *			W1ABC>APRS,RPT1*,WIDE3-2
 *			W1ABC>APRS,RPT2*,WIDE3-2
 *			W1ABC>APRS,RPT3*,WIDE3-2
 *
 *		(4) Someone could be sending the same thing over and 
 *			over with very little delay in between.
 *
 *			W1ABC>APRS,WIDE3-3
 *			W1ABC>APRS,WIDE3-3
 *			W1ABC>APRS,WIDE3-3
 *
 *		We can catch the first two by looking for 'mycall' in
 *		the source or digipeater fields.
 *
 *		The other two cases require us to keep a record of what
 *		we transmitted recently and test for duplicates that 
 *		should be dropped.
 *		
 *		Once we have the solution to catch cases (3) and (4)
 *		there is no reason for the special case of looking for
 *		mycall.  The same technique catches all four situations.
 *
 *		For detecting duplicates, we need to look
 *			+ source station
 *			+ destination 
 *			+ information field
 *		but NOT the changing list of digipeaters.
 *
 *		Typically, only a checksum is kept to reduce memory 
 *		requirements and amount of compution for comparisons.
 *		There is a very very small probability that two unrelated 
 *		packets will result in the same checksum, and the
 *		undesired dropping of the packet.
 *
 * References:	Original APRS specification:
 *
 *			TBD...

 *		The easiest way to catch all cases is to call dedup_remember()

 *

 *		When acting as a KISS TNC, we should just shovel everything
 *		through and not question what the application is doing.
 *		If the connected application has a digipeating function,
 *		it's responsible for those decisions.
 *
 *		My current thinking is that dedupe_remember() should be 
 *		called BEFORE tq_append() in the digipeater case.
