In APRS, the AX.25  Destination address is not used for packet 
routing as is normally done in AX.25.  So APRS uses it for two 
things.  The initial APxxxx is used as a group identifier to make 
APRS packets instanantly recognizable on shared channels.  Most 
applicaitons ignore all non APRS packets.  The remaining 4 xxxx
bytes of the field are available to indicate the software version 
number or application.  The following applications have requested

REGISTERED ALTNETS:
-------------------

ALTNETS are uses of the AX-25 tocall to distinguish specialized
traffic that may be flowing on the APRS-IS, but that are not intended
to be part of normal APRS distribution to all normal APRS software
operating in normal (default) modes.  Proper APRS software that
honors this design are supposed to IGNORE all ALTNETS unless the 
particular operator has selected an ALTNET to monitor for.    

An example is when testing; an author may want to transmit objects 
all over his map for on-air testing, but does not want these to
clutter everyone's maps or databases.  He could use the ALTNET of
"TEST" and client APRS software that respects the ALTNET concept
should ignore these packets.

An ALTNET is defined to be ANY AX.25 TOCALL that is NOT one of the
normal APRS TOCALL's.  The normal TOCALL's that APRS is supposed to
process are:  ALL, BEACON, CQ, QST, GPSxxx and of course APxxxx.

The following is a list of ALTNETS that may be of interest to other
users.  This list is by no means complete, since ANY combination of
characters other than APxxxx are considered an ALTNET.  But this list 
can give consisntecy to ALTNETS that may be using the global APRS-IS 
and need some special recognition:

  TEST   - A generic ALTNET for use during testing
  PSKAPR - PSKmail .  But it is not AX.25 anyway
